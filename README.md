## Phonebook Application 

A  Flutter application project that uses a REST API (made using Node.js, Express and Mongoose Library, MongoDB for its database and then cloud integrated to Heroku) and secured by using JWT.


## Updates - Task 005 
Updated App by adding Headers to deliver tokens for API access (Allowing application to access all routes).
Modified delete popup UI.
Fixed errors upon deletion of contact.
Tried to implement a contact display screen and adding the edit and delete buttons (placed in experimental and will need more time to fix due to errors and pixel glitches).
